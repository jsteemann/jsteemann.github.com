    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just stumbled across <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and wanted to give it a try.
Octopress looks very promising: it is a blogging framework for developers, and it can be used from the command line.
Posting becomes as easy as
<code>
rake new_post[...]              # create file for new post
vim source/_posts/post-file     # edit post
rake generate &amp;&amp; rake deploy    # deploy
</code>
I'd rather use that than UI-based posting a la Wordpress.
Additionally, it provides easy integration with git and Github pages. The blog posts are stored in a git repository, and the static blog content can be pushed to Github pages easily.</p>

<p>The Octopress site mentions it requires Ruby version 1.9.3, so I tried installing that with rvm. However, making that Ruby version failed due to some openssl libraries not being found though they're definitely available on the system.
I thus installed the prebuilt Ruby package for Ubuntu and could go on.</p>

<p>The following Octopress setup was easy as described on its webpage.
In summary, Octopress allowed to set up a blog in around 30 minutes. It will be even less if the correct Ruby version is already installed and Github pages are already set up for your Github account.</p>
