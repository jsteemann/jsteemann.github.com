    <link href="http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/08/30/on-building-aql-query-strings/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-30T23:14:42+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/08/30/on-building-aql-query-strings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote two recipes about generating AQL query
strings. They are contained in the ArangoDB cookbook by now:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.arangodb.com/cookbook/AvoidingInjection.html">Avoiding parameter injection in AQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.arangodb.com/cookbook/MultilineQueryStrings.html">Writing multi-line AQL queries</a></li>
</ul>


<p>After that, Github user <em>tracker1</em> suggested in <a href="https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/1457">Github issue 1457</a>
to take the ES6 template string variant even further, using a generator function for
string building, and also using promises and ES7 async/await.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t use ES7 async/await in ArangoDB at the moment due to lacking support
in V8, but the suggested template string generator function seemed to be an
obvious improvement that deserved inclusion in ArangoDB.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically, the suggestion is to use regular JavaScript variables/expressions in
the template string and have them substituted <em>safely</em>.</p>

<p>With regular AQL bind parameters, a query looks like this:</p>

<p><code>``js
var bindVars = { name: "test" };
var query =</code>FOR doc IN collection</p>

<pre><code>         FILTER doc.name == @name 
         RETURN doc._key`;
</code></pre>

<p>db._query(query, bindVars);
```</p>

<p>This is immune to parameter injection, because the query string and the bind parameter
value are passed in separately. But it&rsquo;s <strong>not very ES6-y</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, after partly implementing <em>tracker1</em>&rsquo;s suggestion, JavaScript values
and expressions can be used much more <em>naturally</em> when building AQL query strings:</p>

<p><code>``js
var name = "test";
var query = aqlQuery</code>FOR doc IN collection</p>

<pre><code>                 FILTER doc.name == ${name} 
                 RETURN doc._key`;
</code></pre>

<p>db._query(query);
```</p>

<p><code>${name}</code> is regular ES template string syntax and would normally be substituted
with the value of JavaScript variable <code>name</code>. Such simple substitution would be unsafe,
because it would make the query vulnerable to parameter injection. So we&rsquo;re also
using a template string generator function named <code>aqlQuery</code>. This function comes
bundled with ArangoDB 2.7.</p>

<p>Under the hood, <code>aqlQuery</code> will create regular AQL bind parameters for each occurrence
of a template string parameter. It will keep the query string and the actual bind
parameter values separate, so it is safe to use.</p>

<p>The function will return an object with that can directly be passed on to the
<code>db._query()</code> function. Here&rsquo;s what <code>aqlQuery</code> will generate for the above example
(note: some whitespace was removed from the output):</p>

<p>```js
{
  &ldquo;query&rdquo; : &ldquo;FOR doc IN collection FILTER doc.name == @value0 RETURN doc._key&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;bindVars&rdquo; : {</p>

<pre><code>"value0" : "test" 
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The <code>aqlQuery</code> template string generator function is available in 2.7, which is
currently in development. The changes are contained in the <code>devel</code> branch only
at the moment, but will become available in following 2.7 release. A pull request
has been issued to have the cookbook recipes updated to include <code>aqlQuery</code>, too.</p>

<p><code>aqlQuery</code> can be used in 2.7 from the ArangoShell, inside arangod (e.g. from inside
Foxx actions) and from ArangoDB&rsquo;s web interface.</p>

<p>All other variants for building AQL queries are still fully supported.</p>

    <link href="http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/08/01/how-v8-is-used-in-arangodb/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-01T19:06:04+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/08/01/how-v8-is-used-in-arangodb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ArangoDB allows running user-defined JavaScript code in the database.
This can be used for more complex, <em>stored procedures</em>-like database operations.
Additionally, ArangoDB&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.arangodb.com/foxx/">Foxx framework</a> can
be used to make any database functionality available via an HTTP REST API.
It&rsquo;s easy to build microservices with it, using the scripting functionality
for tasks like access control, data validation, sanitation etc.</p>

<p>We often get asked how the scripting functionality is implemented under the hood.
Additionally, several people have asked how ArangoDB&rsquo;s JavaScript functionality
relates to node.js.</p>

<p>This post tries to explain that in detail.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>The C++ parts</h1>

<p><em>arangosh</em>, the ArangoShell, and <em>arangod</em>, the database server, are written in
C++ and they are shipped as native code executables. Some parts of both <em>arangosh</em>
and <em>arangod</em> itself are written in JavaScript (more on that later).</p>

<p>The I/O handling in <em>arangod</em> is written in C++ and uses libev (written in C)
for the low-level event handling. All the socket I/O, working scheduling and
queueing is written in C++, too. These are parts that require high parallelism,
so we want this to run in multiple threads.</p>

<p>All the indexes, the persistence layer and many of the fundamental operations,
like the ones for document inserts, updates, deletes, imports are written in C++ for
effective control of memory usage and parallelism. AQL&rsquo;s query parser is written
using the usual combination of Flex and Bison, which generate C files that are
compiled to native code. The AQL optimizer, AQL executor and many AQL functions are
writting in C++ as well.</p>

<p>Some AQL functions however, are written in JavaScript. And if an AQL query
invokes a user-defined function, this function will be a JavaScript function, too.</p>

<h1>How ArangoDB uses V8</h1>

<p>How is JavaScript code executed in ArangoDB?</p>

<p>Both <em>arangosh</em> and <em>arangod</em> are linked against the <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/">V8 JavaScript engine</a>
library. V8 (itself written in C++) is the component that runs the JavaScript
code in ArangoDB.</p>

<p>V8 requires JavaScript code to run in a so-called <em>isolate</em> (note: I&rsquo;ll be
oversimplifying a bit here &ndash; in reality there are isolates and contexts).
As the name suggests, isolates are completely isolated from each other.
Especially, data cannot be shared or moved across isolates, and each isolate
can be used by only one thread at a time.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how <em>arangosh</em>, the ArangoShell, uses V8. All JavaScript commands
entered in <em>arangosh</em> will be compiled and executing with V8 immediately.
In <em>arangosh</em>, this happens using a single V8 isolate.</p>

<p>On the server side, things are a bit different. In <em>arangod</em>, there are multiple
V8 isolates. The number of isolates to create is a startup configuration
option (<code>--javascript.v8-contexts</code>). Creating multiple isolates allows running
JavaScript code in multiple threads, truly parallel. Apart from that, <em>arangod</em>
has multiple I/O threads (<code>--scheduler.threads</code> configuration option) for handling
the communication with client applications.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, part of ArangoDB&rsquo;s codebase itself is written in JavaScript,
and this JavaScript code is executed the same way as any user-defined will be executed.</p>

<h1>Executing JavaScript code with V8</h1>

<p>For executing any JavaScript code (built-in or user-defined), ArangoDB will invoke
V8&rsquo;s JIT compiler to compile the script code into native code and run it.</p>

<p>The JIT compiler in V8 will not try extremely hard to optimize the code on the
first invocation. On initial compilation, it will aim for a good balance of
optimizations and fast compilation time. If it finds some code parts are called
often, it may re-try to optimize these parts more aggressively automatically.
To make things even more complex, there are different JIT compilers in V8
(i.e. Crankshaft and Turbofan) with different sweet spots. JavaScript modes
(i.e. <em>strict mode</em> and <em>strong mode</em>) can also affect the level of optimizations
the compilers will carry out.</p>

<p>Now, after the JavaScript code has been compiled to native code, V8 will run it
until it returns or fails with an uncaught exception.</p>

<p>But how can the JavaScript code access the database data and server internals?
In other words, what actually happens if a JavaScript command such as the following
is executed?</p>

<p><code>js example JavaScript command
db.myCollection.save({ _key: "test" });
</code></p>

<h2>Accessing server internals from JavaScript</h2>

<p>Inside <em>arangod</em>, each V8 isolate is equipped with a global variable named <code>db</code>.
This JavaScript variable is a wrapper around database functionality written in C++.
When the <code>db</code> object is created, we tell V8 that its methods are C++ callbacks.</p>

<p>Whenever the <code>db</code> object is accessed in JavaScript, the V8 engine will therefore
call C++ methods. These provide full access to the server internals, can do whatever
is required and return data in the format that V8 requires. V8 then makes the
return data accessible to the JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Executing <code>db.myCollection.save(...)</code> is effectively two operations: accessing the
property <code>myCollection</code> on the object <code>db</code> and then calling function <code>save</code> on that
property. For the first operation, V8 will invoke the object&rsquo;s <code>NamedPropertyHandler</code>,
which is a C++ function that is responsible for returning the value for the property
with the given name (<code>myCollection</code>). In the case of <code>db</code>, we have a C++ function
that collection object if it exists, or <code>undefined</code> if not.</p>

<p>The collection object again has C++ bindings in the background, so calling function
<code>save</code> on it will call another C++ function. The collection object also has a (hidden)
pointer to the C++ collection. When <code>save</code> is called, we will extract that pointer
from the <code>this</code> object so we know which C++ data structures to work on. The <code>save</code>
function will also get the to-be-inserted document data as its payload. V8 will
pass this to the C++ function as well so we can validate it and convert it into
our internal data format.</p>

<p>On the server side, there are several objects exposed to JavaScript that have C++
bindings. There are also non-object functions that have C++ bindings. Some of these
functions are also bolted on regular JavaScript objects.</p>

<h2>Accessing server internals from ArangoShell</h2>

<p>When running the same command in <em>arangosh</em>, things will be completely different.
The ArangoShell may run on the same host as the <em>arangod</em> server process, but it may
also run on a completely different one. Providing <em>arangosh</em> access to server internals
such as pointers will therefore not work in general. Even if <em>arangosh</em> and <em>arangod</em>
do run on the same host, they are independent processes with no access to the each
other&rsquo;s data. The latter problem could be solved by having a shared memory segment
that both <em>arangosh</em> and <em>arangod</em> can use, but why bother with that special case
which will provide no help in the general case when the shell can be located on
<strong>any</strong> host.</p>

<p>To make the shell work in all these situations, it uses the HTTP REST API provided
by the ArangoDB server to talk to it. For <em>arangod</em>, any ArangoShell client is just
another client, with no special treatments or protocols.</p>

<p>As a consequence, all operations on databases and collections run from the ArangoShell
are JavaScript wrappers that call their respective server-side HTTP APIs.</p>

<p>Recalling the command example again (<code>db.myCollection.save(...)</code>), the shell will first
access the property <code>myCollection</code> of the object <code>db</code>. In the shell <code>db</code> is a regular
JavaScript object with no C++ bindings. When the shell is started, it will make an
HTTP call to <em>arangod</em> to retrieve a list of all available collections, and register
them as properties in its <code>db</code> object. Calling the <code>save</code> method on one of these
objects will trigger an HTTP POST request to the server API at <code>/_api/document?collection=myCollection</code>,
with the to-be-inserted data in its request body. Eventually the server will respond
and the command will return with the data retrieved from the server.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>Consider running the following JavaScript code:</p>

<p><code>js code to insert 1000 documents
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {
  db.myCollection.save({ _key: "test" + i });
}
</code></p>

<p>When run from inside the ArangoShell, the code will be executed in there. The shell will
perform an HTTP request to <em>arangod</em> for each call to <code>save</code>. We&rsquo;ll end up with 1,000
HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Running the same code inside <em>arangod</em> will trigger no HTTP requests, as the server-side
functions are backed with C++ internals and can access the database data directly. It will
be a lot faster to run this loop on the server than in <em>arangosh</em>. A while ago I wrote
<a href="/blog/2014/08/30/understanding-where-operations-are-executed/">another article</a> about this.</p>

<p>When replacing the ArangoShell with another client application, things are no different.
A client application will not have access to the server internals, so all it can do is to
make requests to the server (by the way, the principle would be no different if we used
MySQL or other database servers, only the protocols would vary).</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a fix for this: making the code run server-side. For example, the
above code can be put into a Foxx route. This way it is not only fast but will be made
accessible via an HTTP REST API so client applications can call it with a single HTTP request.</p>

<p>In reality, database operations will be more complex than in the above example. And this
is where having a full-featured scripting language like JavaScript helps. It provides all
the features that are needed for more complex tasks such as validating and sanitizing input
data, access control, executing database queries and postprocessing results.</p>

<h1>The differences to node.js</h1>

<p>To start with: ArangoDB is not node.js, and vice versa. ArangoDB is not a node.js module
either. ArangoDB and node.js are completely indepedent.</p>

<p>But there is a commonality: both ArangoDB and node.js use the V8 engine for running
JavaScript code.</p>

<h2>Threading</h2>

<p>AFAIK, standard node.js only has a single V8 isolate to run all code in.
While that made the implementation easier (no hassle with multi-threading) it
also limits node.js to using only a single CPU.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to see a multi-core server with a node.js instance maxing out
one CPU while the other CPUs are sitting idle. In order to max out a multi-core
server, people often start multiple node.js instances on a single server. That will
work fine, but the node.js instances will be independent, and sharing data between
them is not possible in plain JavaScript.</p>

<p>And because a node.js instance is single-threaded, it is also important that
code written for node.js is non-blocking. Code that blocks while waiting for
some I/O operation would block the only available CPU. Using non-blocking
I/O operations allows node.js to queue the operation, and execute other code
in the meantime, allowing overall progress. This also makes it look like it
would be executing multiple actions in parallel, while it is actually executing
them sequentially.</p>

<p>Contrary, <em>arangod</em> is a multi-threaded server. It can serve multiple requests in
parallel, using multiple CPUs. Because <em>arangod</em> has multiple V8 isolates that
each can execute JavaScript code, it can run JavaScript in multiple threads in parallel.</p>

<p><em>arangosh</em>, the ArangoShell, is single-threaded and provides only a single V8 isolate.</p>

<h2>Usage of modules</h2>

<p>Both node.js and ArangoDB can load code at runtime so it can be organized into
modules or libraries. In both, extra JavaScript modules can be loaded using the
<code>require</code> function.</p>

<p>There is often confusion about whether node.js modules can be used in ArangoDB.
This is probably because the answer is &ldquo;<em>it depends!</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>node.js packages can be written in JavaScript but they can also compile to native
code using C++. The latter can be used to extend the functionality of node.js with
features that JavaScript alone wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of. Such modules however often
heavily depend on a specific V8 version (so do not necessarily compile in a node.js
version with a different version of V8) and often rely on node.js internals.</p>

<p>ArangoDB can load modules that are written in pure JavaScript. Modules that
depend on non-JavaScript functionality (such as native modules for node.js) or modules
that rely on node.js internals cannot be loaded in ArangoDB. As a rule of thumb,
any module will run in ArangoDB that is implemented in pure JavaScript, does not
access global variables and only requires other modules that obey the same restrictions.</p>

<p>ArangoDB also uses several externally maintained JavaScript-only libraries, such as
underscore.js. This module will run everywhere because it conforms to the mentioned
restrictions.</p>

<p>ArangoDB also uses several other modules that are maintained on npm.js.
An example module is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aqb">AQB</a>, a query builder for AQL.
It is written in pure JavaScript too, so it can be used from a node.js application and
from within ArangoDB. If there is an updated version of this module, we use npm to
install it in a subdirectory of ArangoDB. As per npm convention, the node.js modules
shipped with ArangoDB reside in a directory named <code>node_modules</code>. Probably this is
what caused some of the confusion.</p>

    <link href="http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/07/14/es6-features-in-arangodb-27/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-14T20:33:55+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2015/07/14/es6-features-in-arangodb-27</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ArangoDB 2.6 uses V8 engine version 3.31.74.1 for running its own and all user-defined
JavaScript code. In ArangoDB 2.7 (currently in development), we have upgraded V8 to
version 4.3.61.</p>

<p>The new V8 version in ArangoDB 2.7 provides several additional ES6 features that can
be used to improve JavaScript usability and code quality. This blog post showcases <em>strong
mode</em> and <em>rest parameters</em>, and also shows how to activate <em>TurboFan</em>, V8&rsquo;s new JIT compiler
for JavaScript.</p>

<p>ArangoDB 2.7 is in development right now, but it can be tried today by
<a href="/blog/2014/10/16/how-to-compile-arangodb-from-source/">compiling it from source</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>JavaScript strong mode</h2>

<p>V8 v4 comes with an optional and experimental <em>strong mode</em>. This mode provides only a
subset of JavaScript, with the idea of intentionally deactivating some of
<a href="http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html">JavaScript&rsquo;s bad parts</a>.
It is based on <em>strict mode</em>, but goes further.</p>

<p>Committing to <em>strong mode</em> may not only provide better and stronger semantics, but may
also enable more optimization opportunities for the JavaScript compiler. For example, the
strong mode disables JavaScript&rsquo;s <em>with</em> statement and <code>delete</code>! Additionally, <code>var</code> cannot
be used anymore but is deprecated in favor of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal for the strong mode can be found
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qk0qC4s_XNCLemj42FqfsRLp49nDQMZ1y7fwf5YjaI4/view">here</a>,
and the V8 team also has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments">page about it</a>.</p>

<p>Strong mode must be turned on explicitly. This can be done by adding the <code>--strong-mode=true</code>
v8 option when starting <em>arangod</em> or <em>arangosh</em>:</p>

<p><code>bash enabling strong mode
arangosh  --javascript.v8-options="--strong_mode=true"
</code></p>

<p>Note that I am using <em>arangosh</em> above, but the same would work for <em>arangod</em>, too, so the feature
can be used for Foxx routes as well.</p>

<h2>Rest parameters</h2>

<p>How to pass a variable number of arguments to a function?</p>

<p>C and C++ programmers have been using and abusing the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) and <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> features
of the C preprocessor for a long time. Then came the macros of <code>stdarg.h</code> / <code>cstdarg</code>,
until C++11 really improved the situation with <code>std::initializer_list</code> and variadic templates.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, one can use the <code>arguments</code> object:
```js
function logSimple () {
  for (value of arguments) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log(value);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>logSimple(&ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;baz&rdquo;);
```</p>

<p>This does the job, and the above will print something like:
<code>plain
2015-07-14T19:01:51Z [5245] INFO foo
2015-07-14T19:01:51Z [5245] INFO bar
2015-07-14T19:01:51Z [5245] INFO baz
</code></p>

<p>This is fine as long as all arguments shall be treated the same way. But what if some
arguments have a designated meaning and should be treated specially?</p>

<p>The solution is to use <em>ES6 rest parameters</em>. The last parameter in an argument list can be
prefixed with <code>...</code> to capture any number of function parameters:</p>

<p>```js
function logWithContext (context, &hellip;values) {
  for (value of values) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log('[' + context + '] ' + value);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>logWithContext(&ldquo;es6&rdquo;, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;baz&rdquo;);
```</p>

<p>As can be seen, the <code>logWithContext</code> function specially handles its <code>context</code> argument, while
we can still pass any number of further parameters into it. Here&rsquo;s what the above will print:</p>

<p><code>plain
2015-07-14T19:07:27Z [5245] INFO [es6]: foo
2015-07-14T19:07:27Z [5245] INFO [es6]: bar
2015-07-14T19:07:27Z [5245] INFO [es6]: baz
</code></p>

<p>Note that rest parameters cannot be used with the default configuration and must be turned on
explicitly in <em>arangosh</em> or <em>arangod</em>.</p>

<p>The startup option to turn them on is:</p>

<p><code>bash enabling rest parameters
arangosh --javascript.v8-options="--harmony_rest_parameters=true"
</code></p>

<h2>TurboFan</h2>

<p>The new V8 version comes with <em>TurboFan</em>, a new JIT compiler for JavaScript.
According to <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2015/07/revving-up-javascript-performance-with.html">this post</a>
it is already used in Chrome for compiling certain types of JavaScript code.</p>

<p>As fas as I can see, it is turned off by default in our version of V8, and the compiler
also seems to be rather experimental. To get an idea of what it can already do and where
its limits are, it can already be tried in ArangoDB 2.7.</p>

<p>By default, it seems to be turned off. Using the following startup option, it can be turned on for
JavaScript functions with a certain name pattern (i.e. all function names starting with <em>testTurboFan</em>):</p>

<p><code>bash starting ArangoShell with TurboFan enabled
arangosh --javascript.v8-options="--turbo-filter=testTurboFan*"`
</code></p>

<p>Without turning on V8 tracing, one will not be able to tell which compiler is used to compile a
specific function. To turn it on and actually confirm V8 is using TurboFan, use these options:</p>

<p><code>bash starting ArangoShell with TurboFan and debug output
arangosh --javascript.v8-options="--always-opt --trace_opt --turbo-filter=testTurboFan*"
</code></p>

<p>This will be very verbose, but it is good to tell which internal compiler is used to compile a given
JavaScript function.</p>

<p>For example, after starting the ArangoShell with the above options, run the following test code
to see that V8 uses TurboFan for compiling the first two functions (which match the name pattern),
and Crankshaft for the third (which does not match the name pattern):</p>

<p>```js test code for invoking the TurboFan compiler
function testTurboFan1 () {
  console.log(&ldquo;turbo-fan 1&rdquo;);
}
testTurboFan1();</p>

<p>function testTurboFan2 () {
  console.log(&ldquo;turbo-fan 2&rdquo;);
}
testTurboFan2();</p>

<p>function testSomethingElse () {
  console.log(&ldquo;something else&rdquo;);
}
testSomethingElse();
```</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the confirmation that TurboFan is used:</p>

<p><code>plain debug output
...
[compiling method 0x31ca8804e351 &lt;JS Function testTurboFan1 (SharedFunctionInfo 0x31ca8804e171)&gt; using TurboFan]
...
[compiling method 0x31ca8804e7f9 &lt;JS Function testTurboFan2 (SharedFunctionInfo 0x31ca8804e619)&gt; using TurboFan]
...
[compiling method 0x31ca8804ec71 &lt;JS Function testSomethingElse (SharedFunctionInfo 0x31ca8804ea91)&gt; using Crankshaft]
...
</code></p>

<p>The new API allows fetching multiple documents from the server using a single

<p>The straight-forward implementation of a client application that needs to

var keys = [ &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;baz&rdquo;, &hellip;];</p>

<p>// sequentially fetch all documents from the server
var results = [ ];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; keys.length; ++i) {
  results.push(db.test.document(keys[i]));
}
// now all documents are contained in variable &lsquo;results&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>This works fine but causes excessive HTTP communication between the client
application and the server when many documents need to be fetched. In fact,
the above code will issue as many HTTP requests as there are documents to fetch.</p>

<p>From the performance point of view, it would be much better to reduce the
number of HTTP requests, and retrieve multiple documents from the server in
one go, using a single request.</p>

<p>This is where the new document lookup function comes into play. Provided the
documents keys are known, all the client application needs to do is to call the
collection&rsquo;s <code>lookupByKeys</code> method:</p>

<p>```js bulk method: fetching multiple documents at once
// list of document keys
var keys = [ &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;baz&rdquo;, &hellip;];</p>

<p>var results = db.test.lookupByKeys(keys);
// now all documents are contained in variable &lsquo;results&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>Following is a comparison of the execution times for the two different methds.
All test runs were conducted in the same ArangoDB 2.6 instance. The tests were
run from the ArangoShell. The ArangoShell and the ArangoDB server were located on
the same physical host.</p>

<p>```plain comparing single document requests and bulk requests</p>

<h2>Number of keys     Single documents        Bulk</h2>

<pre><code>     1,000               0.24 s      0.04 s
    10,000               1.23 s      0.31 s
   100,000              10.89 s      2.13 s
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As can be seen, the bulk method can provide a substantial speedup in case lots
of documents need to be fetched by their keys at once. The actual speedups might be
even higher when using a remote ArangoDB server instead of a localhost connection.</p>

<p>In 2.6 there is currently an ArangoShell implementation for bulk document lookups.
Other drivers will follow.</p>

<p>Additionally, the server-side REST API method for bulk document lookups can be
invoked directly via HTTP as follows:</p>

<p><code>plain invoking bulk document lookups via HTTP
curl                                                  \
  -X PUT                                              \
  http://127.0.0.1:8529/_api/simple/lookup-by-keys    \
  --data '{"collection":"test","keys":["foo","bar","baz"]}'
</code></p>

<p>Restrictions: the bulk document API works only with document keys, not document ids.
Additionally, it works on a single collection at a time and cannot be leveraged to fetch
documents from multiple collections. Still, a client application can group document keys
by collection beforehand and send one bulk request per involved collection. Finally,
trying to fetch a document using a non-existing key will not produce an error with the
bulk API. Using the one-by-one method, trying to fetch a non-existing document will throw
an exception.</p>

    <link href="http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2014/12/19/using-es6-features-in-arangodb/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-19T19:12:06+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsteemann.github.io/blog/2014/12/19/using-es6-features-in-arangodb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ArangoDB 2.4 will be shipped with an <em>updated version of V8</em>.</p>

<p>The V8 version included in 2.4 will be 3.29.59. This version will replace the
almost two year old 3.16.14. A lot of things happened in V8 since then, and a lot
of ES6 features have been added to it.</p>

<p><strong>ES6 is not finalized yet</strong>, and support for it is a <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">work in progress on all
platforms</a>.</p>

<p>ES6 provides many cool features that can make JavaScript developer&rsquo;s life easier.
In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll summarize a few ES6 features that are available in
ArangoDB, either for scripting purposes in the ArangoShell, or in your server-side
Foxx actions inside the database.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to put you off until Doomsday. ArangoDB 2.4 should be released next
week. Time to play with some ES6 features!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Summary for the impatient</h1>

<p>The following ES6 features are available in ArangoDB 2.4 by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterators</li>
<li>the <code>of</code> operator</li>
<li>symbols</li>
<li>predefined collections types (Map, Set etc.)</li>
<li>typed arrays</li>
</ul>


<p>Many other ES6 features are disabled by default, but can be made available by
starting arangod or arangosh with the appropriate options:</p>

<ul>
<li>arrow functions</li>
<li>proxies</li>
<li>generators</li>
<li>String, Array, and Number enhancements</li>
<li>constants</li>
<li>enhanced object and numeric literals</li>
</ul>


<p>To activate all these ES6 features, start arangod or arangosh with the following
options:</p>

<pre><code>arangosh --javascript.v8-options="--harmony --harmony_generators"
</code></pre>

<h1>Activating ES6 features</h1>

<p>Work on ES6, also dubbed <em>Harmony</em> or <em>ES.next</em>, is still in progress. At the time
of this writing, the ES6 specification was still in draft status.</p>

<p>Therefore no platform has implemented all ES6 features yet. And because ES6 is
still a moving target, the already implemented features should still be considered
experimental.</p>

<p>This is true for all environments that implement ES6 features. For example, Firefox
and other browsers contain lots of experimental ES6 features already, providing a
notice that these might change in future versions.</p>

<p>V8 is no exception here. It has turned most ES6 features off by default, but it
provides several command-line options to turn them on explicitly.</p>

<p>The V8 version used for ArangoDB 2.4 provides the following ES6-related switches:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--harmony_scoping</code> (enable harmony block scoping)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_modules</code> (enable harmony modules (implies block scoping))</li>
<li><code>--harmony_proxies</code> (enable harmony proxies)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_generators</code> (enable harmony generators)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_numeric_literals</code> (enable harmony numeric literals (0o77, 0b11))</li>
<li><code>--harmony_strings</code> (enable harmony string)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_arrays</code> (enable harmony arrays)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_arrow_functions</code> (enable harmony arrow functions)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_classes</code> (enable harmony classes)</li>
<li><code>--harmony_object_literals</code> (enable harmony object literal extensions)</li>
<li><code>--harmony</code> (enable all harmony features (except proxies))</li>
</ul>


<p>These switches are all off by default. To turn on features for either arangod
or arangosh, start it with the V8 option(s) wrapped into the ArangoDB option
<code>--javascript.v8-options</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>arangosh --javascript.v8-options="--harmony_proxies --harmony_generators --harmony_array"
</code></pre>

<p>On a side note: node.js is also using V8. Turning on ES6 features in node.js almost
works the same way. Just omit the surrounding <code>--javascript.v8-options="..."</code>:</p>

<pre><code>node --harmony_proxies --harmony_generators --harmony_array
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the V8 options can only be set for the entire process (i.e. arangosh, arangod
or node.js), and not just for a specific script or application. In reality this shouldn&rsquo;t be
too problematic as the vast majority of ES6 features is downwards-compatible to ES5.1.</p>

<h1>ES6 features by example</h1>

<p>Following I have listed a few select ES6 features that are usable in ArangoDB 2.4,
in no particular order. I have omitted a few ES6 features that aren&rsquo;t supported in bundled
V8 version, and also omitted <em>classes</em> and <em>modules</em> due to lack of time.</p>

<h2>Arrow functions</h2>

<p>ES6 provides an optional arrow function syntax. The arrow function syntax is a shorthand for
writing a full-blown function declaration. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p>```js a simple arrow function
/<em> defines function pow </em>/
var pow = (value => value * value);</p>

<p>/<em> calls pow </em>/
pow(15);  /<em> 225 </em>/
```</p>

<p>Arrow functions can also take multiple parameters. The syntax then becomes:
```js arrow function with multiple parameters
/<em> defines function sum </em>/
var sum = (a, b) => a + b;</p>

<p>/<em> calls sum </em>/
sum(3, 7);  /<em> 10 </em>/
```</p>

<p>So far we have only seen arrow functions with simple expressions, but arrow function bodies
can also be more complex and can contain multiple statements:
```js more complex arrow functions
var translations = {
  &ldquo;en&rdquo; : &ldquo;English&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;fr&rdquo; : &ldquo;French&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;de&rdquo; : &ldquo;German&rdquo;
};</p>

<p>/<em> using multiple statements </em>/
[&ldquo;en&rdquo;, &ldquo;fr&rdquo;, &ldquo;xx&rdquo;].map(value => {
  if (translations.hasOwnProperty(value)) {</p>

<pre><code>return translations[value];
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  return &ldquo;unknown!&rdquo;;
});
```</p>

<p>Arrow functions are turned off by default. To enable them in arangod or arangosh, start them
with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_arrow_functions"</code>.</p>

<h2>Maps and sets</h2>

<p>ES6 maps provide a specialized alternative to regular objects in case a <em>lookup-by-key</em>
functionality is required.</p>

<p>When no maps are available, storing keys mapped to objects is normally done using a plain
object. With ES6, the same use case can be handled with using a <strong>Map</strong> object:
```js using an ES6 Map object
var m = new Map();</p>

<p>/<em> set 5M keys </em>/
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5000000; ++i) {
  m.set(&ldquo;test&rdquo; + i, i);
}
```</p>

<p>ES6 maps can be more efficient than plain objects in some cases. For the above case of
storing 5M entries, an ES6 map is about twice as fast as a plain object on my laptop.
Though there might be cases we are plain objects are still faster.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to ES6 Maps than just efficiency:</p>

<ul>
<li>ES6 maps provide a member <code>size</code> which keeps track of the number of objects in the map.
This is hard to achieve with a plain object.</li>
<li>Objects can only have string keys, whereas map keys can have different key types.</li>
<li>They don&rsquo;t inherit keys from the prototype, so there is no <code>hasOwnProperty</code> hassle with Maps.</li>
</ul>


<p>ES6 also comes with a specialized <strong>Set</strong> object. The Set object is a good alternative to
plain JavaScript objects when the use case is to track unique values. Using a Set is more
intuitive, potentially more efficient and may require even less memory than when implementing
the same functionality with a plain JavaScript object:</p>

<p>```js using an ES6 Set object
var s = new Set();</p>

<p>/<em> set 5M values </em>/
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5000000; ++i) {
  s.add(&ldquo;test&rdquo; + i);
}
```</p>

<p>Maps and sets are enabled by default in arangod and arangosh. No special configuration is needed
to use them in your code.</p>

<h2>Proxy objects</h2>

<p>Proxy objects can be used to intercept object property accesses at runtime. This can be used
for meta-programming in many real-world situations, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>preventing, auditing and logging property accesses</li>
<li>calculated / derived properties</li>
<li>adding a compatibility layer on top of an object</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example that logs property accesses on the proxied object:
```js using a Proxy object
var proxy = Proxy.create({
  get: function (obj, name) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("read-accessing property '%s'", name);
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  set: function (obj, name) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("write-accessing property '%s'", name);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});</p>

<p>proxy.foo = &ldquo;bar&rdquo;;   /<em> write-accessing property &lsquo;foo&rsquo; </em>/
proxy.foo;           /<em> read-accessing property &lsquo;foo&rsquo; </em>/
```</p>

<p>Proxy objects are not available by default. To enable them in arangod or arangosh, start them
with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_proxies"</code>.</p>

<h2>Iterators and generators</h2>

<p>ES6 provides generators and iterators. They can be used individually or in combination.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple example of a generator that will generate only two values:
```js a simple generator that generates two values
function* generate () {
  yield 23;
  yield 42;
}</p>

<p>var generator = generate();
console.log(generator.next());  /<em> { &ldquo;value&rdquo; : 23, &ldquo;done&rdquo; : false } </em>/
console.log(generator.next());  /<em> { &ldquo;value&rdquo; : 42, &ldquo;done&rdquo; : false } </em>/
console.log(generator.next());  /<em> { &ldquo;value&rdquo; : undefined, &ldquo;done&rdquo; : true } </em>/
<code>``
As can be seen above, the value yielded by the generator function will be returned
wrapped into an object with a</code>value<code>and a</code>done` attribute automatically.</p>

<p>The general pattern to consume all values from a generator function is to call
its <code>next()</code> method until its <code>done</code> value is <code>true</code>:
```js consuming all values from a generator function
var generator = generate();</p>

<p>while (true) {
  value = generator.next();
  if (value.done) {</p>

<pre><code>break;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  console.log(value.value);
}
```</p>

<p>An alternative to that is to use an iterator (note the new <code>of</code> operator):
```js consuming all values from a generator function
var generator = generate();</p>

<p>for (var value of generator) {
  console.log(value);
}
```</p>

<p>Generator functions produce their values lazily. Therefore it is possible
and not inefficent to write generators that produce never-ending sequences.
Though one must be careful to abort iterating over the generator values
at some point if the sequence does not terminate:
```js a generator producing an endless sequence
function* generate () {
  var i = 0;
  while (true) {</p>

<pre><code>yield ++i;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>var generator = generate();</p>

<p>/<em> note: this will not terminate </em>/
for (var value of generator) {
  console.log(value);
}
```</p>

<p>We have now seen two uses of iterators as part of the previous examples.
As demoed, generator function values can be iterated with the <code>of</code> operator
without any further ado. Apart from generators, a few other built-in types
also provide ready-to-use iterators. The most prominent are <code>String</code> and <code>Array</code>:
```js iterating over the characters of a string
var text = &ldquo;this is a test string&rdquo;;</p>

<p>for (var value of text) {
  console.log(value);
}
```
The above example will iterate all the individual characters of the string.</p>

<p>The following example iterates the values of an Array:
```js iterating over the values of an array
var values = [ &ldquo;this&rdquo;, &ldquo;is&rdquo;, &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;test&rdquo; ];</p>

<p>for (var value of values) {
  console.log(value);
}
<code>``
This will produce</code>&ldquo;this&rdquo;<code>,</code>&ldquo;is&rdquo;<code>,</code>&ldquo;a&rdquo;<code>,</code>&ldquo;test&rdquo;<code>. This is normally what is
desired when iterating over the values of an Array. Compare this to the</code>in<code>
operator which would produce</code>0<code>,</code>1<code>,</code>2<code>and</code>3` instead.</p>

<p>Map and Set objects also implement iterators:
```js iterating over the contents of a Map
var m = new Map();</p>

<p>m.set(&ldquo;Sweden&rdquo;, &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;);
m.set(&ldquo;China&rdquo;, &ldquo;Asia&rdquo;);
m.set(&ldquo;Bolivia&rdquo;, &ldquo;South America&rdquo;);
m.set(&ldquo;Australia&rdquo;, &ldquo;Australia&rdquo;);
m.set(&ldquo;South Africa&rdquo;, &ldquo;Africa&rdquo;);</p>

<p>for (var value of m) {
  console.log(value);
}
```</p>

<p>Note that Maps also provide dedicated iterators for just their keys or
their values:
```js iterating over keys and values of a Map
for (var country of m.keys()) {
  console.log(country);
}</p>

<p>for (var continent of m.values()) {
  console.log(continent);
}
```</p>

<p>Rolling an iterator for your own object is also possible by implementing the method
<code>Symbol.iterator</code> for it:
```js creating an iterator for an object
function Sentence (text) {
  this.text = text;
}</p>

<p>/<em> create the actual iterator method </em>/
/<em> note that the iterator is a generator function here </em>/
Sentence.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function*() {
  var regex = /\S+/g;
  var text = this.text;
  var match;
  while (match = regex.exec(text)) {</p>

<pre><code>yield match[0]; 
</code></pre>

<p>  }
};</p>

<p>var sentence = new Sentence(&ldquo;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&rdquo;);
/<em> invoke the iterator </em>/
for (var word of sentence) {
  console.log(word);
}
```</p>

<p>Generators and iterators are not available by default. To enable them in arangod
or arangosh, start them with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_generators"</code>.</p>

<h2>String enhancements</h2>

<p>ES6 provides the following convenience string functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>string.startsWith(what)</li>
<li>string.endsWith(what)</li>
<li>string.includes(what)</li>
<li>string.repeat(count)</li>
<li>string.normalize(method)</li>
<li>string.codePointAt(position)</li>
<li>String.fromCodePoint(codePoint)</li>
</ul>


<p>These functions are mostly self-explaining, so I won&rsquo;t explain them in more
detail here. Apart from that, these functions are turned off by default.
To enable them in arangod or arangosh, start them with the option
<code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_strings"</code>.</p>

<h2>Array enhancements</h2>

<p>ES6 provides the following enhancements for the <code>Array</code> object:</p>

<ul>
<li>array.find(function)</li>
<li>array.findIndex(function)</li>
<li>array.keys()</li>
<li>array.values()</li>
<li>Array.observe(what, function)</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are a few examples demoing these functions:
```js Array enhancements
var values = [ 1, 2, 9, 23, 42 ];</p>

<p>/<em> returns the first Array element for which the function returns true </em>/
values.find(function (value) {
  return value === 23;
});</p>

<p>/<em> returns the first Array index for which the function returns true </em>/
values.findIndex(function (value) {
  return value === 23;
});</p>

<p>/<em> iterate over the keys of the Array </em>/
for (var key of values.keys()) {
  console.log(key);
}</p>

<p>/<em> iterate over the values of the Array </em>/
for (var key of values.values()) {
  console.log(key);
}</p>

<p>/<em> observe all changes to an Array </em>/
Array.observe(values, function (changes) {
  console.log(changes);
});</p>

<p>/<em> trigger a change to the observed Array </em>/
values.push(117);
```</p>

<p>The Array enhancements are turned off by default. To enable them in arangod or
arangosh, start them with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_arrays"</code>.</p>

<h2>Number enhancements</h2>

<p>The <code>Number</code> object is extended with the following ES6 functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number.isInteger(value)</li>
<li>Number.isSafeInteger(value)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are also <code>Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER</code> and <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> so applications
can programmatically check whether a numeric value can still be stored in the range of
-2<sup>53</sup> to +2<sup>53</sup> without potential precision loss.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>The <code>const</code> keyword can be used to define a read-only constant. The constant must be
initialized and a variable with the same name should not be redeclared in the same scope.</p>

<p>Here is an example of using <code>const</code>:
<code>js using const to create a read-only variable
function calculate (value) {
  const magicPrime = 23;
  return magicPrime ^ value;
}
</code></p>

<p>In non-strict mode, <code>const</code> variables behave non-intuitively. Re-assigning a value
to a variable declared <code>const</code> does not throw an exception, but the assignment will
not be carried out either. Instead, the assignment will silently fail and the <code>const</code>
variable will keep its original value:</p>

<p><code>js re-assigning a value to a const variable
function mystery () {
  const life = 42;
  life = 23;        /* does not change value and does not throw! */
  return life;      /* will return 42 */
}
</code></p>

<p><code>js re-assigning a value to a const variable, using strict mode
function mystery () {
  "use strict";
  const life = 42;
  life = 23;        /* will throw SyntaxError "assignment to constant variable" */
}
</code></p>

<p>The <code>const</code> keyword is disabled by default. To enable it in arangod or arangosh,
start them with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_scoping"</code>.</p>

<h2>Enhanced object literals</h2>

<p>ES6 provides a shorthand for defining methods in object literals.</p>

<p>The following example creates a normal method named <code>save</code> in <code>myObject</code>:</p>

<p>```js shorthand method declaration
var myObject = {
  type: &ldquo;myType&rdquo;,
  save () {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("save");
</code></pre>

<p>  }
};
```</p>

<p>Interestingly, the object literals seem to work for method declarations only.
I did not get them to work for non-method object properties, though ES6 allows that.
It seems that this is not implemented in V8 yet.</p>

<p>Enhanced object literals are turned off by default. To enable them in arangod
or arangosh, start them with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_object_literals"</code>.</p>

<h2>Enhanced numeric literals</h2>

<p>For the ones that love working with binary- or octal-encoded numbers, ES6 has
support for this too:
<code>js numeric literals
var life = 0b101010;          /* binary, 42 in decimal */
var filePermissions = 0o777;  /* octal, 511 in decimal */
</code></p>

<p>Enhanced numeric literals are turned off by default. To enable them in arangod
or arangosh, start them with the option <code>--javascript.v8-options="--harmony_numeric_literals"</code>.</p>

<h2>Symbols</h2>

<p>ES6 also provides a Symbol type. Symbols are created using the global <code>Symbol()</code> function.
Each time this function is called, a new Symbol object will be created.
A Symbol can be given an optional name, but this name cannot be used to identify the
Symbol later. However, Symbols can be compared by identity.</p>

<p>What one normally wants is to use the same Symbol from different program parts. In this
case, a Symbol should not be created with the <code>Symbol()</code> function, but with <code>Symbol.for()</code>.
This will register the Symbol in a global symbol table if it is not there yet, and return
the Symbol if already created:</p>

<p>```js using named Symbols
var typeAttribute = Symbol.for(&ldquo;type&rdquo;);
var carType = Symbol.for(&ldquo;car&rdquo;);
var trainType = Symbol.for(&ldquo;train&rdquo;);</p>

<p>var object1 = { };
object1[typeAttribute] = carType;</p>

<p>var object2 = { };
object2[typeAttribute] = trainType;</p>

<p>/<em> check if the objects have the same type </em>/
object1[typeAttribute] === object2[typeAttribute];  /<em> false </em>/
object1[typeAttribute] === carType;                 /<em> true </em>/
object2[typeAttribute] === carType;                 /<em> false </em>/
object2[typeAttribute] === trainType;               /<em> true </em>/
```</p>

<p>Symbol object properties are not enumerated by default, so they can be used to implement
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; or internal properties.</p>

<p>Symbols can be used by default in arangod and arangosh. No special configuration is required.</p>

<h2>TypedArrays</h2>

<p>TypedArrays are Arrays whose members all have the same type and size. They are more
specialized (read: limited but efficient) alternatives to the all-purpose <code>Array</code> type.</p>

<p>TypedArrays look and feel a bit like C arrays, and they are often used as an Array-like
view into binary data (for which JavaScript has no native support).</p>

<p>A TypedArray is created (and all of its memory is allocated) by invoking the appropriate
TypedArray constructor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Int8Array</li>
<li>Uint8Array</li>
<li>Uint8ClampedArray</li>
<li>Int16Array</li>
<li>Uint16Array</li>
<li>Int32Array</li>
<li>Uint32Array</li>
<li>Float32Array</li>
<li>Float64Array</li>
</ul>


<p>```js using an Array of unsigned 8 bit integers
var data = new Uint8Array(2);
data[0] = 0b00010101;  /<em> 23 </em>/
data[1] = 0b00101010;  /<em> 42 </em>/</p>

<p>console.log(data[0]);  /<em> 23 </em>/
console.log(data.length * data.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); /<em> 2 bytes </em>/
```</p>

<p>```js using an Array of 64 bit floating point values
var data = new Float64Array(2);
data[0] = 23.23;</p>

<p>console.log(data[0]);  /<em> 23.23 </em>/
console.log(data[1]);  /<em> 0.0 </em>/
console.log(data.length * data.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); /<em> 16 bytes </em>/
```</p>

<p>TypedArrays can be used in arangod and arangosh by default. No special
configuration is required to activate them.</p>

<h2>Unsupported ES6 features</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, V8 does not yet support every proposed ES6 feature.
For example, the following ES6 features are currently missing:</p>

<ul>
<li>template strings</li>
<li>function default parameters</li>
<li>rest function parameter</li>
<li>spread operator</li>
<li>destructuring</li>
<li>array comprehension</li>
<li><code>let</code></li>
</ul>


<p>I strongly hope these features will make it into the final version of ES6 and will be
implemented by the V8 team in future versions of V8.</p>

<p>Apart from that, a lot of nice ES6 features are there already and can be used
in ArangoDB applications.</p>
